MVC (Model-View-Controller)->
is a software architectural pattern that divides applications into three interconnected components—Model (data),
View (UI), and Controller (logic)—to separate business logic from user interface. It enhances scalability and maintainability,
widely used in web frameworks and GUI development.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Key Components of mvc->
Model (Data Layer): Manages the application's data, rules, and logic. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
View (Presentation Layer): Displays data to the user (e.g., HTML, GUI) and sends user actions to the Controller.
Controller (Input Layer): Acts as an interface between Model and View, processing user requests, manipulating the Model, and updating the View. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Workflow->
Request: User interacts with the View (e.g., clicks a button), sending a request to the Controller.
Logic: The Controller receives the request and, if necessary, updates the Model.
Data: The Model processes the data and notifies the View (or the Controller updates the View).
Display: The View renders the updated data for the user. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits
Separation of Concerns: Clearly separates business logic, UI, and input logic, leading to cleaner, more manageable code.
Parallel Development: Different teams can work on the Model, View, and Controller simultaneously.
Reusability: Enables using the same model with different views.
Testability: Facilitates testing of components independently.
