Autoloading->
in PHP is a mechanism that automatically loads class, interface, and trait definitions only when they are needed, eliminating the need for manual require or include statements for every file.
This results in cleaner code, easier maintenance, and improved performance through lazy loading. 
The modern and recommended approach for autoloading in PHP is using Composer and the PSR-4 standard.
