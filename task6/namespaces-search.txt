PHP Namespaces->
PHP namespaces are used to prevent naming conflicts between classes, interfaces, functions, and constants.
Namespaces are used to group related code together under a name - to avoid naming conflicts when your code grows, or when you use code from multiple sources.

Why Use Namespaces?
1-To avoid name conflicts, especially in larger projects
2-To organize code into logical groups
3-To separate your code from code in libraries
4-To allow the same name to be used for more than one class, without conflict

Using Namespaces
Any code that follows a namespace declaration is operating inside the namespace,
so classes that belong to the namespace can be instantiated without any qualifiers.
To access classes from outside a namespace, the class needs to have the namespace attached to it.
